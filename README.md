# Datanote

Datanote is an open-source application for named entity
visualization.

## Warning

Please be indulgent regarding the quality of the code.
The whole thing started off as an experiment and proof of concept, when I did not know about React, Electron or MobX. 
In 2015-2016 this was my first project using these technologies, and it only supported ES2015.

I know some parts need to be rewritten, and they will be:
It's only a question of money, which can buy brain time.
Right now the project is **not funded** so I develop it
during my spare time, and it is difficult to advance it
as quickly as I would like to.

In summary: **do not expect things to work out of the box as you would like. You will have to try to tweak some things by yourwelf, dig into the code, and be patient.**
