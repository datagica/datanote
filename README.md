# Datanote

Datanote is an open-source application for named entity
visualization.

## Note from the developer

Please be indulgent regarding the quality of the code.
The whole thing started off as an experiment and proof of concept, when I did not know about React, Electron or MobX. 
In 2015-2016 this was my first project using these technologies, and it only supported ES2015.

I know some parts need to be rewritten, and they will be:
It's only a question of money, which can buy brain time.
Right now the project is *not funded* so I develop it
during my spare time, and it is difficult to make it advanced
as much as I would like to.

In summary: *do not expect things to work as you expect out of the box. You will have to try to tweak some things by yourwelf, dig into the code, be patient etc..*
